🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing an Income Evaluation dataset using Python (Pandas).
The cleaned dataset is prepared for data analysis, machine learning models, and Power BI visualization.

The goal is to transform raw, unclean data into a structured, error-free, and analysis-ready dataset.
